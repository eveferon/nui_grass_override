This is a NUI grass override tool for working with https://lexicon.nwn.wiki/index.php/SetAreaGrassOverride.

It allows you to quickly test the grass override on your areas to select the ones that work best for your area and even persist it using a simple system I provided in the module.

For demonstration purposes, there is a small video https://youtu.be/bp5tiHp-c0k 

Feel free to test and contribute. There are certainly some issues and areas for improvement but is more than enough to get started.

If you have issues using it, go to NWN Developers Discord (https://discord.gg/zHMubRfR) and PM Siala
